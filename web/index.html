                                RiverSafe is designed to test the pollution levels of water,
                                to help combat big companies putting sewage into rivers, and to spread awareness of it

                            This is a useful table containing what the Pollution Level seen measured here actually means. As you can see, most tap water will be 100-400, but anything over that can be dangerous.
