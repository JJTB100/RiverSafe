                RiverSafe is designed to test the pollution levels of water,
                to help combat big companies putting sewage into rivers, and to spread awareness of it. The dial to the left shows the current water pollution that is being picked up by the sensor attached to our RaspberryPi Pico.

            This is a useful table containing what the Pollution Level seen measured here actually means. As you can see, most tap water will be 100-400, but anythin over that can be dangerous.
