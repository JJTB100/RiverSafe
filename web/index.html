            RiverSafe is designed to test the pollution levels of water,
            to help combat big companies putting sewage into rivers, and to spread awareness of it. The dial bellow shows the current water pollution that is being picked up by the sensor attached to our RaspberryPi Pico. (Work In Progress: It's just random at the moment)
