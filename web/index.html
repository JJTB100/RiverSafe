        <h1>RiverSafe</h1>
        <p><i>This project is made by <b>Jonathan, Zak and Isaac</b> <br>
            We are students at Fulford School who are passionate about the world and have the skills to help save it.<br>
            Special thanks to <b>Mr Dring</b>, without whom this project would not have been possible.</i><br><br>
            RiverSafe is designed to test the pollution levels of water,<br>
            to help combat big companies putting sewage into rivers, and to spread awareness of it.
